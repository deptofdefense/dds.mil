**The U.S. Defense Digital Service and the Department of the Air Force Announce Bricks in the Air, an Avionics Hacking Workshop built with LEGO® Bricks in the Aerospace Village for DEF CON 28 Safe Mode.**

WASHINGTON – July 28, 2020 – Bricks in the Air, designed and developed by the Defense Digital Service (DDS) in partnership with the Department of the Air Force, is a four-bay avionics hacking workshop for beginners taking place in the Aerospace Village at the first-ever virtual DEF CON 28 Safe Mode from Aug 6-9, 2020. First introduced at DEF CON 27 (2019) by the DDS team, Bricks in the Air is built with LEGO® Bricks’ Technic series and engineered by DDS to allow players to simulate hacking airplanes to expose, and subsequently secure, vulnerabilities. These workshops are meant to be educational and the U.S. Government does not condone hacking for malicious gain.

“When it comes to securing DoD’s most critical assets, we invite hackers because they think like hackers,” says Brett Goldstein, Director of the Defense Digital Service. “Nefarious hackers don’t abide by a ‘security checklist’ or ‘playbook.’ Their approach is fluid, unpredictable, and the best way to be prepared for such attacks in aviation is to flip the script on how the DoD thinks about security.”

Since DEF CON is now in Safe Mode due to COVID-19,[ all 4 DDS and USAF workshops](https://dds.mil/defcon/) will be conducted virtually at [dds-virtual.com](http://dds-virtual.com). Participation in the Bricks in the Air workshop will be open from Aug 6, 2020 to August 9, 2020, and players will need a Twitch account to participate. The workshop consists of 4 simulated airplanes in four bays:

1. Mad Props, a cargo airplane
2. Huey Lewis and The Views, a heavy-lift helicopter
3. Spinderella, a rescue helicopter
4. Hella Props, a heavy-lift helicopter

In addition to the Bricks in the Air avionics workshop, DDS and the USAF are also hosting two satellite hacking workshops, CPX SimpleSat, and DDSat-1, in addition to the ground station hacking workshop, Nyan-Sat, developed with Red Balloon Security. The first 500 players to complete one of the Bricks in the Air, CPX SimpleSat, or DDSat-1 challenges will receive a “Bricks in the Air” DEF CON t-shirt.

“Space is the final frontier for cybersecurity. It’s imperative we work with experienced ethical hackers, as well as inspire a new generation to pursue STEM, to keep space free and secure for commerce and exploration,” says Dr. Roper, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. “We believe this is best achieved through collaboration with communities like DEF CON.”

This and other workshops are the hands-on learning part of the Space Security Challenge 2020: Hack-A-Sat, a joint effort by the U.S. Defense Digital Service and the Department of the Air Force. The Hack-A-Sat Capture the Flag (CTF), a multi-stage challenge for more advanced security researchers, kicked off in late May with a qualification event that hosted over 2,000 teams from around the world. Eight of the most talented teams have been invited to the Hack-A-Sat final event taking place virtually Aug 7-9 on hackasat.com. Together, the Hack-A-Sat CTF and the educational workshops contribute to the Aerospace Village’s mission of building an inclusive community of next-generation aerospace cybersecurity expertise and leaders.
