**The U.S. Defense Digital Service, the Department of the Air Force and Red Balloon Security Announce NyanSat, a Virtual Satellite Hacking Workshop in the Aerospace Village for DEF CON 28 Safe Mode**

WASHINGTON – July 8, 2020 – NyanSat, designed and developed by Red Balloon Security in partnership with the U.S. Defense Digital Service (DDS) and the Department of the Air Force, is a three-part virtual satellite hacking workshop. NyanSat kicks off the first of four virtual hacking workshops hosted by the U.S. Defense Digital Service and the Department of the Air Force taking place in the Aerospace Village at the first-ever virtual DEF CON 28 Safe Mode from Aug 6-9, 2020. These workshops are meant to be educational and the U.S. Government does not condone hacking for malicious gain.

“Through our Hack the Pentagon series and now Hack-A-Satellite, we are reframing the age-old DoD adage that in order for a thing to be secure, it must be kept a secret. In reality, the ethical hacking mindset embraces external, industry experts and allows for proactive measures for mitigating attack surfaces of a satellite system,” said Brett Goldstein, Director of the Defense Digital Service.

Participation in NyanSat will be open from July 7, 2020 to August 9, 2020 at [Nyan-Sat.com](Nyan-Sat.com). The workshop consists of three fun, non-competitive challenges: building your own satellite tracking antenna, exploiting a ground station modem, and participating in our live-streamed, internet-accessible, community ground station event. Participants will be able to listen in on satellites passing overhead and provide input on what objects to track through the NyanSat Discord Channel. Since DEF CON is now in Safe Mode due to COVID-19, this and other workshops will be conducted virtually in the Aerospace Village.

“The ultimate goal with these events is to show how accessible a lot of this technology actually is, and encourage more members of the infosec community to start researching these security issues and coming up with better ways to protect this technology from sophisticated threat actors,” said Dr. Ang Cui, CEO of Red Balloon Security.

NyanSat builds on the spy-movie-style capture-the-flag hacking challenge “[No Mr. Bond, I Expect You to Hack](https://www.wpafb.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/1925991/air-force-research-laboratory-griffiss-institute-and-red-balloon-security-to-la/),” run by the Department of the Air Force and Red Balloon Security at DEF CON 27. More than 20 participants exploited vulnerabilities in commercial products such as cameras, door locks, and communication systems to learn more about the perils and promises of the Internet of Things (IoT) security devices. The three-staged “attack the base” challenge piloted a new model for the Air Force to hire cybersecurity talent, by offering the winner an opportunity to work a split internship between the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and Red Balloon Security.

This year, the U.S. Defense Digital Service, the Department of the Air Force, and Red Balloon Security are partnering to bring this workshop to the Aerospace Village as another learning component that supports the mission of building an inclusive community of next-generation aerospace cybersecurity expertise and leaders.
