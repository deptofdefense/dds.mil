The Defense Innovation Board recommended the Department of Defense take note of guidance pulled from the Defense Digital Service playbook for hiring and recruiting technical talent at its quarterly public meeting on Tuesday, September 15. 

The Defense Innovation Board, a committee of private-sector experts, provides recommendations from an industry and academic perspective to the Department of Defense and its military services.

Like many recent events across the Department, this quarterly meeting was conducted virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Workforce, Behavior, and Culture subcommittee lead a discussion on how new norms like remote work introduced by the pandemic have impacted the Department. 

Jennifer Palkha, subcommittee chair and Executive Director of Code for America called Defense Digital Service a "bright spot for productivity in this new world."

"They have seen staff able to really deliver on mission. They're seeing increases in their own productivity," Palkha said.

The Defense Digital Service team transitioned to all-remote work in compliance with public health safety recommendations in March of 2020. In the preceding six months, the team has brought on thirty new employees.

Palkha encouraged Department leadership to consider standardizing and integrating remote work to improve its recruitment and retention of technical talent. 

The Board unanimously approved an [addendum](https://innovation.defense.gov/Portals/63/documents/Meeting%20Documents/September%2015%202020/DIB_Digital%20Talent_CLEARED.pdf?ver=2020-09-15-111827-080) based in part on Defense Digital Service's best practices and tools for technical talent recruitment and remote work culture.
