While 2020 hasn’t been the year for getting out, that doesn’t mean we haven’t been diligently working on some incredible projects with the U.S. military service branches. Wondering how we’ve focused our efforts working remotely?

What if we told you we’d helped the Navy track the coronavirus on their warships? Or, if we said we had used the popular gaming platform, Twitch, to bring DEF CON 28 conference into people’s homes and to engage hackers to [Hack a Satellite](https://www.wired.com/story/the-feds-want-these-teams-to-hack-a-satellite-from-home/)? And then there’s that Raiders of the Lost Ark-like treasure trove of [55M human tissue samples](https://www.fedscoop.com/dod-digitization-respiratory-disease-database/) that is poised to be a game-changer in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. We have heaps of stories to share, and we need your help to share them at SXSW 2021.

Always on-trend, SXSW is going virtual in 2021. We’re thrilled to have submitted six unique panels for inclusion in the digital line-up. Lucky for us, the public gets a chance to shape next year’s agenda. Go to the SXSW [panel picker](<SXSW panel picker>) before November 20th to vote for our panels.
