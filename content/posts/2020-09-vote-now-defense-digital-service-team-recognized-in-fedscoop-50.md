It‚Äôs time to vote...for the FedScoop 50 Awards!

Six of our team members and one project have been nominated for the [FedScoop 50 Awards](https://www.fedscoop.com/fedscoop50/vote/), an annual competition designed to highlight and celebrate the best and brightest in the U.S. Federal Government.

No other single government office has as many nominees; DDS has more nominees than several federal departments, too. That is 12% of the federal government‚Äôs best and brightest tech minds on one team (more, if you count out each of the team members involved in building BOBA...and we do).

We‚Äôre so proud of the recognition. It takes a team to do good work, and an amazing team we have!

Voting has been extended through October 30th and we‚Äôre calling on you to [VOTE NOW](https://www.fedscoop.com/fedscoop50/vote/)! Winners will be announced on November 16th. ü§ûüèº
