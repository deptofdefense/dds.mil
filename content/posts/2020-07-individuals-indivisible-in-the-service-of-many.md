Defense Digital Service does not have just one story, it has many. Each member of DDS brings a fresh set of priorities, values, and lived experiences to the team and we are stronger for it.

[Maya Keong](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/defensedigitalservice_westpointwomen-asianamerican-digitalsecurity-activity-6684127559006920704-kfaY), a West Point grad and project analyst on the Hack the Pentagon team, says, “A growth mindset and increased diversity are what make us stronger together in service to our nation."

"The work we do \[is] not about the glory. It’s about saving lives,” says [Savan Kong](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6682680546969186304), serial entrepreneur and one of our product managers.

We are technologists, but we are also spouses, parents, immigrants, veterans, and entrepreneurs.

We are united in our dedication to doing good.

"I have always had the desire to do work that gives back," says Brett Laurets, who worked in the private sector for more than 20 years before joining DDS in 2020. One of the first projects he has lead for the team is MySymptoms.Mil, the COVID-19 symptom checking tool created for the U.S. military community. 

"It feels great to be part of a team that dedicates itself to improving the lives of the people that are committed to protecting our freedom," Brett says.

From the first day…
