      "mdMain": "### Portfolios\n\nThese sustained engagements are expansive and provide opportunities for DDS to champion long-term, large-scale change across the DoD.\n\n**Counter-UAS Program** \n\nRogue Squadron is a counter-small unmanned aerial systems (C-sUAS) group within DDS. It is composed of technical experts, laser-focused on providing cutting-edge, rapid-prototyped solutions at the speed of relevance based on real-time feedback and asks of the warfighter and partner-agencies in support of national security.\n\nRogue Squadron has a strong history of equipping U.S. warfighters with the best sUAS and C-UAS solutions today and preparing them for future challenges. Ongoing development and support include:\n\n* **Sensor Development and Integration:** Small UAS consistently violate airspace around DoD installations; some installations lack reliable, comprehensive sUAS detection capability. Integrated with our cloud-based user interface (UI), our sensor helps military and federal agencies to acquire and maintain clear situational awareness in their airspace.\n* **Dowding: User Interface for Situational Awareness**<br />Warfighters need a user interface (UI) that can detect sUAS, display results accurately, and utilize data to support the processing required to react and defeat sUAS threats.  Dowding gives drone analysts the ability to observe and assess drone activity from Windtalker and Porg sensors, which cover DJI and Parrot drones (>80% of the sUAS marketplace). Threat analysis and mobile capabilities are the essential next step for this product to address the need to make informed decisions for the mitigation of potential sUAS threats.\n* **Integrated User Interface:** Warfighters need a UI that can detect sUAS, display results accurately, and utilize data to react and defeat sUAS threats. Access needs to be real-time, cloud-based, secure, and accessible. Our Integrated UI supports a repository of data that is robust and evolving to support machine learning and reduces the fatigue of in-theater operators. \n* **Rapid Response and Technology Consultation:** Providing a centralized repository for education and development within the sUAS and C-UAS space is part of the DDS mission. Rogue Squadron does this by evaluating the C-UAS space, identifying gaps in available technology, and rapid prototyping to fill those gaps.\n* **Safe Drone Operations:** Rogue Squadron sets clear standards for the safe operation of commercial-off-the-shelf drone and drone detection equipment to support warfighters.\n\n<br />**Hack the Pentagon Program**\n\nDDS established the Hack the Pentagon program in November 2016 as the Federal Government’s first-ever bug bounty program. Following best practices from the private sector, bug bounties allow independent hackers to research and disclose security vulnerabilities on DoD assets (both external-facing websites/applications and certain sensitive internal systems), sometimes in exchange for financial reward. Participants go through background checks and can be citizens of any country except Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia. The Air Force, Army, and other military departments and DoD agencies now use bug bounties or crowdsourced hacking assessments as an optimal way to harness the depth and breadth of technical talent across the globe to help secure DoD’s digital assets. When Hack the Pentagon began, limited companies were operating in the space and most focused on either private assessments or public assessments. DDS stood up two IDIQs, or Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts, one for private bounties and one for public bounties. Since that time, the landscape has changed, and today companies work on both public and private challenges, obviating the need for a distinction. Beginning in FY 2020, DDS consolidated these separate contracts into a single multi-award IDIQ vehicle.\n\nIn 2016 the DoD also published its first vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP), which has resulted in the DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) receiving over 15,705 vulnerabilities as of April 2020 from 1,624 security researchers at no cost to the DoD. Find all ongoing activity for the VDP here: <https://hackerone.com/DeptOfDefense>. DDS is currently engaged with OSD Policy to expand the VDP to include all DoD Information Systems to help further protect DoD assets and critical information infrastructure."
