Teams are staffed according to technical needs and the project ends with the successful transition of technology back to the host organization.\n\n### Recent examples include:\n\n**MySymptoms.mil**\n\nDDS designed [MySymptoms.mil](https://MySymptoms.mil) specifically for the DoD community to check and assess COVID-19 symptoms. [MySymptoms.mil](https://MySymptoms.mil) was created at the direction of the Secretary of Defense.\n\n[MySymptoms.mil](https://MySymptoms.mil) is an anonymous tool designed with DoD personnel in mind. It does not diagnose disease but assesses the likelihood someone may have COVID-19 based on a series of simple health-related questions, and then provides information on how to seek further advice. [MySymptoms.mil](https://MySymptoms.mil) was built on a .mil domain to ensure the DoD community can access it regardless of the network they use. \n\n**Project Holocron**\n\nIn collaboration with the Department of the Navy and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), DDS developed the real-time ability to detect and evaluate threats posed by small-Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS). The threat posed by sUAS in the homeland is different than in theater, with recreational and commercial sUAS traffic common and currently indistinguishable from actual threats. Project Holocron assists warfighters in understanding what they are seeing, helps developers build defeat capabilities based on what is actually flying, and enables program offices to resource systems based on validated analysis. This project was DDSâ€™s first collaboration with the Navy.\n\n**Defense Personal Property Program (DP3)**\n\nDDS worked with the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) to replace the current Defense Personal Property System (DPS) with a new solution that reduces stress for nearly 425,000 service members and their families that go through the Permanent Change of Station (PCS) process each year. DDS rebuilt Move.mil, the informational website that helps service members and their families plan for their upcoming PCS, and officially transitioned it to USTRANSCOM in March 2018.\n\nDDS also initiated the replacement of DPS with a mobile-friendly web application (MilMove) built using modern software processes on commercial cloud infrastructure. Using an OTA, DDS contracted with a software engineering and user experience design firm in December 2017 to lead the redesign. By designing with the users, onboarding with the new MilMove now only takes a few minutes and can be completed from the comfort of their own home on their personal device. DDS transitioned MilMove back to USTRANSCOM in September 2019 for continued development, expansion and support for the Global Household Goods RFP (GHC)."
