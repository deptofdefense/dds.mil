Teams are staffed according to technical needs and the project ends with the successful transition of technology back to the host organization.\n\n### Recent examples include:\n\n**Project Holocron**\n\nIn collaboration with the Department of the Navy and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), DDS developed the real-time ability to detect and evaluate threats posed by small-Unmanned Aerial Systems (sUAS). The threat posed by sUAS in the homeland is different than in theater, with recreational and commercial sUAS traffic common and currently indistinguishable from actual threats. Project Holocron assists warfighters in understanding what they are seeing, helps developers build defeat capabilities based on what is actually flying, and enables program offices to resource systems based on validated analysis. This project was DDS’s first collaboration with the Navy.\n\n**Defense Personal Property Program (DP3)**\n\nDDS worked with the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) to replace the current Defense Personal Property System (DPS) with a new solution that reduces stress for nearly 425,000 service members and their families that go through the Permanent Change of Station (PCS) process each year. DDS rebuilt Move.mil, the informational website that helps service members and their families plan for their upcoming PCS, and officially transitioned it to USTRANSCOM in March 2018.\n\nDDS also initiated the replacement of DPS with a mobile-friendly web application (MilMove) built using modern software processes on commercial cloud infrastructure. Using an OTA, DDS contracted with a software engineering and user experience design firm in December 2017 to lead the redesign. By designing with the users, onboarding with the new MilMove now only takes a few minutes and can be completed from the comfort of their own home on their personal device. DDS transitioned MilMove back to USTRANSCOM in September 2019 for continued development, expansion and support for the Global Household Goods RFP (GHC).\n\n**Hack The Pentagon**\n\nDDS established the Hack the Pentagon program in November 2016 as the Federal Government’s first-ever bug bounty program. Following best practices from the private sector, bug bounties allow independent hackers to research and disclose security vulnerabilities on DoD assets, sometimes in exchange for financial reward.\n\nThe Air Force, Army, and other military departments and DoD agencies now use bug bounties or crowdsourced hacking assessments as an optimal way to harness the depth and breadth of technical talent across the globe to help secure DoD’s digital assets."
