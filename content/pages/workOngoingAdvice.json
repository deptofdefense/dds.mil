These engagements tend to be shorter in duration and usually results in a report that outlines findings and possible technical paths forward.\n\n### Recent examples include:\n\n**Open Skies**\n\nTo support the Open Skies Treaty, a contract was awarded in February 2016 to replace the current optical cameras with a Digital Visual Imaging System (DVIS) in the current OC-135 aircraft and a Digital Ground Processing Station (DGPS). With the project behind schedule and not meeting a scheduled window of opportunity for international certification, Air Force acquisition leadership asked DDS in June 2019 to take a CTO role and drive the project to completion concentrating on operational improvements and implementing modern software methodologies. With DDS leadership, the project pushed through functional software and image quality stabilization in November 2019, just in time for the scheduled Developmental Test flights in December. With the completion of the functional software, DDS exited the project and is monitoring ongoing progress.\n\n**R2D2**\n\nR2D2 was designed and developed in response to the DoD CIO mandate that all Windows-based clients be migrated to the most current operating system. The United States Marine Corps lacked the capability and resourcing required to identify all Windows clients within its IT portfolio. By collecting and sorting the data inputs from various sources, R2D2 seeks to create reports and data visualizations to enable program and portfolio management, inform risk management decisions, and provide metrics. DDS is providing and managing the cloud infrastructure for the development and initial deployment of the application. The short-term goal of the application was to deliver on the WIN10 DoD CIO mandate no later than December 2019, and this has been completed."
