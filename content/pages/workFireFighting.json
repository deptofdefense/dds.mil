[MySymptoms.mil](https://MySymptoms.mil) was created at the direction of the Secretary of Defense.\n\n[MySymptoms.mil](https://MySymptoms.mil) is an anonymous tool designed with DoD personnel in mind. It does not diagnose disease but assesses the likelihood someone may have COVID-19 based on a series of simple health-related questions, and then provides information on how to seek further advice. [MySymptoms.mil](https://MySymptoms.mil) was built on a .mil domain to ensure the DoD community can access it regardless of the network they use."
