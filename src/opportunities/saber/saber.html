    <h2>Our Process</h2>
    <p>
        It is the Government's intention to negotiate, select and fund "best value" Prototype Project(s) from the submitted White Paper(s). The White Paper selection will be conducted in accordance with Government procedures and the evaluation criteria below.  The process is described in full in the Statement of Objectives, but the outline is:

        <ol>
	  <li>Solicit White Paper(s) from Industry (that means you!)</li>
          <li>Select some number of White Paper(s), or some portion of the White Paper(s) to continue in the process</li>
	  <li>Selected vendors will be provided a Technical Exchange document to complete a code challenge</li>
          <li>Request an in-person interview, if required, to select or reject White Paper(s)</li>
        </ol>

    <p>
        In the event that the Government is unable to come to agreement on terms with the initial selectee, the Government can reevaluate the white paper responses and make another selection.
    </p>

    <h2>White Paper Evaluation Criteria</h2>
    <p>
        The overall evaluation will be based on an integrated assessment of the criteria below:
        <ol>
            <li>Technical merit of the proposed solution will be assessed with respect to technical advancement, technical advantages, technical efficiencies and proposed improvements, clarity, and soundness of the technical approach, and the extent to which the Statement of Objectives is addressed. <em>Most emphasis will be placed here.</em></li>
            <li>Adequacy of proposed facilities, equipment and key personnel (senior engineers, designers,and product leadership), to include capability for proper classification level as defined in the Statement of Objectives to meet the requirements of the proposed technological solution.</li>
            <li>Evaluation of the potential impacts of the data rights assertions.</li>
            <li>Evaluation of significant nontraditional and/or small business participation, or one-third (1/3) cost share.</li>
            <li>Affordability of proposed solution.</li>
        </ol>
