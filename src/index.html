        The Department of Defense defends and protects our nation's military and civilians across the globe. Our projects range widely, from strengthening our national security, to taking care of our Veterans, or deploying next-generation GPS for billions of people. However, oftentimes our progress is hindered by outdated tools and practices that lag far behind private sector standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our mission is to drive a giant leap forward in the way DOD builds and deploys technology and digital services. We work alongside our public servants and service members, empowering them to incorporate private sector best practices and talent to build a better <s>future</s> now.
