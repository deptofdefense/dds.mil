      <h1>New DDS Director to Expand High-Impact Technology Initiatives</h1>
      <p class="usa-font-lead">Public, private sector technologist Brett Goldstein named Defense Digital Service Director</p>
      <p>The Department of Defense announced today Brett Goldstein has been appointed Director of the Defense Digital Service (DDS) based at the Pentagon. DDS is an agency team of the U.S. Digital Service, which is part of the Office of Management and Budget. Goldstein was recruited by Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and will be a direct report, tackling critical technology problems for the department.</p>
      <p>The Defense Digital Service is a team charged with bringing in top talent, technology and processes from the private sector to tackle technology problems of impact across the Department of Defense. DDS projects advance DOD's most important initiatives that are critical to the well-being of service members, civilians, and core operations of the department. Team members include top technologists, designers, engineers, and other experts on term-limited 'tours of duty for nerds' at the Pentagon.</p>
      <p>"Under the leadership of Chris Lynch, DDS has hacked the bureaucracy to strengthen our national security and improve the lives of service members and their families," said Acting Secretary Shanahan. "Although we will miss Chris, the unique startup culture he built and the talented team he recruited will continue to disrupt and transform technology at the DOD. We are excited for Brett to be taking on the role of director to build and expand the team and its work. His public and private sector knowledge, technical expertise, and commitment to improving government through technology will be invaluable to a range of critical missions across the department."</p>
      <p>At DDS, Goldstein will focus on continuing to recruit top technical talent from the private sector along with supporting and empowering personnel and service members within the department. He was selected for his diverse leadership experience and technical expertise, which range from enterprise systems and architecture to deep knowledge of data science and cybersecurity, which will be among his early priorities at the department.</p>
      <p>Since opening its doors in 2015, DDS has tackled a wide range of critical problem sets at the DOD. Examples of DDS initiatives include: launching the federal government's first bug bounty program 'Hack the Pentagon'; reforming digital services that provide military families critical health benefits; building next-generation GPS; developing drone detection technologies; hunting adversaries on DOD networks; leading the JEDI cloud procurement; overhauling the logistics system that helps military families move; and redesigning training for cyber soldiers. DDS Director and co-founder Chris Lynch will be stepping down this month.</p>
